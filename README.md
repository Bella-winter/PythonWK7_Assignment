# PythonWK7_Assignment
# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of chocolate sales using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization. It also includes error handling to make the code more robust and user-friendly.

- Matplotlib
- VS code 


**Tasks**


Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

-- Loaded the dataset in CSV format using pandas.

-- Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to inspect the data using .head().

-- Explored the structure of the dataset by checking data types and missing values.

-- Cleaned the dataset by either filling or dropping any missing values.

**Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
Computed basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, sum) using .describe().

Performed groupings on a categorical column (e.g., Amount, Country, or boxes shipped) and computed the mean of a numerical column for each group.

Identified interesting patterns or findings from the analysis, such as trends or correlations.

**Task 3: Data Visualization**
Created at least four different types of visualizations:

1. Line Chart: Showing trends over time (e.g., time-series of sales data).

2. Bar Chart: Comparing a numerical value across categories (e.g., average sales per region).

3. Histogram: Understanding the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., distribution of sales or prices).

4. Scatter Plot: Visualizing the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sales and quantity shipped).

Each plot was customized with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.

**How to Use**
  Open the Chocolate Sales.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any environment that supports .ipynb files.

   Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
